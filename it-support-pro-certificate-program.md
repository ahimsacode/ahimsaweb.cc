## Google IT Support Professional Certificate Program Log
---

### Day 001: Saturday, 12 December 2020
This evening I received an email notification from **Coursera** letting me know that I had been approved for a financial aid grant to cover the cost of my participation in the *Google IT Support Professional Certificate* program. I'm looking forward to getting as much as I can out of this material, and I have decided to create this simple microblog to track my progress through the program.

**Today's Progress:**
Tonight I completed the materials for week 1 of the *Technical Support Fundamentals* course, which introduced the program, went through a brief history of computing, and introduced digital logic and computer architecture.

**Thoughts:**
Overall I found *Technical Support Fundamentals: Week 1* to be very simple beginner-level material, but in all of my years of computing, I'd never actually been given the assignment of counting in binary, and I thought that was pretty cool. I feel like this week 1 was almost too easy, but then again, even in college, most courses start out ridiculously easy for the first week or 2 and then start getting more advanced.
