### Day 3: Monday, 14 December 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Today I completed week 3 of the *Technical Support Fundamentals* course, which covered operating systems. Today's materials, like much of the preceeding material, was mostly review for me. The assessment for the week required me to created a new file in both a Windows 10 and a Linux CLI environment. The task itself was obviously incredibly easy, but I did learn a little in the process because I needed to install and setup Microsoft Remote Desktop for macOS in order to connect to a virtual machine to perform the Windows task, which while not complicated, was a new experience for me. Using Terminal to connect to the Linux machine via SSH was obviously much quicker as I'm fairly experienced with the command line and I didn't need to install any third-party software to complete the task.

**Thoughts:**
It's obvious that this course material is design to build upon itself, so we need to start with the most basic of basics, and while I'm finding the material just interesting enough to keep me engaged, I'm hoping that the material will become more complicated and present more of a challenge as it progresses. On one hand, completing this material may be useful whether I learn much or not, because it will present me with a certificate at the end to show that I am competant in the skills at hand; on the other hand, if I'm going to devote all this time and energy into learning something, I'm hopeful that there will be some real **learning** that comes into play for me at some point. It's also just possible that, having a background in IT and having worked in various entry-level tech roles over the last couple of decades has given me more knowledge than I realized I had.

### Day 2: Sunday, 13 December 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Today I completed week 2 of the *Technical Support Fundamentals* course, which covered hardware basics.

**Thoughts:**
The hardware material covered in today's coursework was mostly review, but it made me miss the days long ago when I used to volunteer with a local nonprofit called **[Free Geek](https://freegeek.org)** tearing apart donated computers and building new Linux-based systems. If we were not living in the middle of a pandemic, this material probably would have resulted in me signing up for regular shifts doing volunteer work with them again. If I were not currently out of work, this week's material probably would have led to me purchasing some old computer parts online and building a new computerâ€”something I used to do for fun all the time, but which I haven't done in well over a decade and a half now. As it is, however, I was unable to do any of those things, but the course did require me to "build" a basic virtual PC to demonstrate that I understood the key components that makeup a computer system and where they go.

### Day 1: Saturday, 12 December 2020
This evening I received an email notification from **Coursera** letting me know that I had been approved for a financial aid grant to cover the cost of my participation in the *Google IT Support Professional Certificate* program. I'm looking forward to getting as much as I can out of this material, and I have decided to create this simple microblog to track my progress through the program.

**Today's Progress:**
Tonight I completed the materials for week 1 of the *Technical Support Fundamentals* course, which introduced the program, went through a brief history of computing, and introduced digital logic and computer architecture.

**Thoughts:**
Overall I found *Technical Support Fundamentals: Week 1* to be very simple beginner-level material, but in all of my years of computing, I'd never actually been given the assignment of counting in binary, and I thought that was pretty cool. I feel like this week 1 was almost too easy, but then again, even in college, most courses start out ridiculously easy for the first week or 2 and then start getting more advanced.
