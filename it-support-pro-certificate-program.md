### Day 2: Sunday, 13 December 2020
**Today's Progress**:
Today I completed week 2 of the *Technical Support Fundamentals* course, which covered hardware basics.

**Thoughts:**
The hardware material covered in today's coursework was mostly review, but it made me miss the days long ago when I used to volunteer with a local nonprofit called **[Free Geek](https://freegeek.org)** tearing apart donated computers and building new Linux-based systems. If we were not living in the middle of a pandemic, this material probably would have resulted in me signing up for regular shifts doing volunteer work with them again. If I were not currently out of work, this week's material probably would have led to me purchasing some old computer parts online and building a new computerâ€”something I used to do for fun all the time, but which I haven't done in well over a decade and a half now.

### Day 1: Saturday, 12 December 2020
This evening I received an email notification from **Coursera** letting me know that I had been approved for a financial aid grant to cover the cost of my participation in the *Google IT Support Professional Certificate* program. I'm looking forward to getting as much as I can out of this material, and I have decided to create this simple microblog to track my progress through the program.

**Today's Progress:**
Tonight I completed the materials for week 1 of the *Technical Support Fundamentals* course, which introduced the program, went through a brief history of computing, and introduced digital logic and computer architecture.

**Thoughts:**
Overall I found *Technical Support Fundamentals: Week 1* to be very simple beginner-level material, but in all of my years of computing, I'd never actually been given the assignment of counting in binary, and I thought that was pretty cool. I feel like this week 1 was almost too easy, but then again, even in college, most courses start out ridiculously easy for the first week or 2 and then start getting more advanced.
