### Day 2: Tuesday, 15 December 2020
**Today's Progress:**
Today I actually spent most of my time coding. I zoomed through The Odin Project's intro to the front-end materials in under and hour, and then I got to the HTML and CSS Basics section where I was assigned the task of completing the tutorial materials for freeCodeCamp's **Responsive Web Design Certification**. The assignment instructions stated, "It’s long and, if you’re new, will take you at least a few days to get through, but it will give you a really solid foundation to build on moving forward. They have some projects at the end. They’re good practice, but you can consider them optional." Since I already completed these tutorials a couple of weeks ago, I was able to skip over them, which brought me to the point where I have caught up with The Odin Project materials and can now return to completing the freeCodeCamp projects, because while The Odin Project may view them as optional, but they are a requirement for me to complete my freeCodeCamp certificates. I picked up where I left off about a week ago and started working on completing the freeCodeCamp *Product Landing Page* project, which I'm hoping to complete tomorrow.

**Thoughts:**
This product landing page assignment is honestly a bit more challenging than I was expecting. It's not terribly complex, but I'm running into a few roadblocks and after working on this for several hours today, I'm ready to give my brain a rest and try at it again fresh tomorrow. 

Because I'm hoping to begin listing links to completed works for freeCodeCamp beginning tomorrow, I thought I should include in this blog links to the two projects I have already completed.

- *[freeCodeCamp Tribute Page Project](https://ahimsaweb.cc/fcc/01-01-tribute-page/) (completed back on 12/05/2020)*
- *[freeCodeCamp Survey Form Project](https://ahimsaweb.cc/fcc/01-02-survey-form/) (completed back on 12/07/2020)*

### Day 1: Monday, 14 December 2020
**Today's Progress:**
I was able to pass over some of the "installations" section of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I am not running a Windows computer, so I had no need to setup a virtual machine (although for fun I did setup a virtual Linux system using VirtualBox). I already have a text editor that I'm happy with, so I was able to skip over having to setup a new text editor (The Odin Project suggests but does not require using VSCode. I have been using Atom for quite sometime and I'm happy with it, so I'm planning to stick with that for now). I reviewed the command line basics materials and while I'm fairly comfortable using the CLI, I did learn a few things and found the time spent to be valuable. Finally, I went through the process of setting up Git, which was helpful as I've only been using Git and Github for a few weeks and did not have everything setup right; that has been corrected.

After the *Installations* section was complete, I moved onto the *Git Basics* section, which again was incredibly useful and I learned a ton and will likely be returning to those materials in the coming days and weeks as I become more comfortable with Git.

**Thoughts:**
I spent less time actually *coding* than I would have expected for day 1 of my 100DaysOfCode challenge, but knowledge was gained, skills were built, and practice was had. All-in-all, I feel like today was a very useful and productive day and my comfort with Git — while still not being anywhere near where I would like it to be — definitely grew from today's experiences. There were even a couple of points in the process where I ran into problems and had to troubleshoot, which of course took up a bit of time, but it is in those problems and the ensuing troubleshooting that learning happens.

### Day Zer0: Sunday, 13 December 2020
Today I have committed myself to spending the next 100 days taking part in the 100DaysOfCode challenge. I will be picking up where I left off a few days ago with [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) and mixing in the curriculum from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

I have created a page to track my [freeCodeCamp progress](/fcc/) and another to track my [Odin Project progress](/top.md).

**Today's Progress:**
In preparation for beginning the 100DaysOfCode challenge, I spent time today going through the introductory materials on the Odin Project and doing some preliminary planning out of the coming 100 days.

**Thoughts:**
I have spent about as much time as I can delaying getting started, but I cannot justify waiting any longer, and I am excited (and, if we're being honest a bit nervous) about the coming 100 days. It's definitely going to be a journey, though!
