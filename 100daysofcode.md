### Day Zer0: Sunday, 13 December 2020
Today I have committed myself to spending the next 100 days taking part in the 100DaysOfCode challenge. I will be picking up where I left off a few days ago with [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) and mixing in the curriculum from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

I have created a page to track my [freeCodeCamp progress](/fcc/) and another to track my [Odin Project progress](/odin-project).

**Today's Progress:**
In preparation for beginning the 100DaysOfCode challenge, I spent time today going through the introductory matarials on the Odin Project and doing some preliminary planning out of the coming 100 days. 

**Thoughts:**
I have spent about as much time as I can delaying getting started, but I cannot justify waiting any longer, and I am excited (and, if we're being honest a bit nervous) about the coming 100 days. It's definitely going to be a journey, though!
