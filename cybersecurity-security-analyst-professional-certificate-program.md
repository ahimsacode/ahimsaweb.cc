### Day 6: Tuesday, 22 December, 2020
**Today's Progress:**  
Today I finished the **Introduction to Databases** and the **Deep Dive. Injection Vulnerability** modules of the **Network Security & Database Vulnerabilities** course, completing all of the material for the **IBM IT Fundamentals for Cybersecurity** specialization certficate.

**Thoughts:**  
6 days ago I signed up for Coursera's 7-day free trial on the  **IBM IT Fundamentals for Cybersecurity** specialization. Today I finished that specialization, earned my certificate, and my free trial was automatically cancelled. A week ago cybersecurity was and always had been a passing interest of mine, but nothing which I had devoted the time and energy into learning like I have in the last few days. These past 6 days have given me a foundation in the basics of cybersecurity from which to grow upon. I still have ***a lot*** to learn, and I'm looking forward to the process of learning it.

Now that I have completed this certificate, I am moving on to work toward the [**IBM Cybersecurity Security Analyst Professional Certificate program**](https://www.ibm.com/training/badge/a471481b-3152-4e09-b43f-ab1d8bf31620). I have created a microblog similar to this on to track my progress [here](cybersecurity-security-analyst-professional-certificate-program.md).

### Day 3: Thursday, 24 December, 2020
**Today's Progress:**  
Today I finished up the **Introduction to Scripting** module and wrapped up the **Penetration Testing, Incident Response and Forensics** course. I then started the **Cyber Threat Intelligence** course by completing module 1 (**Threat Intelligence**).

### Day 2: Wednesday, 23 December, 2020
**Today's Progress:**  
Much of my day was consumed with dealing with some tecnhincal issues not directly related to this course. I did manage to get through module 3 (**Digital Forensics**) and I started module 4 (**Introduction to Scripting**)

**Thoughts:**  
While the digital forensics materials were interesting, I had been looking forward to the module on scripting. I was dissapointed to find the audio quality in the early scripting lessons was absolutely terrible. I can only hope that this audio issue is contained to the couple of lessons I've struggled through so far and that I won't have to put up with this for the remainder of the certificate program.
