## IBM IT Fundamentals for Cybersecurity Log
This simple microblog was created to track my progress through the [IBM IT Fundamentals for Cybersecurity certificate program](https://www.ibm.com/training/badge/aa8b45a3-df14-4874-87bc-5b8c1276407e). 

**UPDATE (2020-12-22)**  
On December 22, 2020 I earned my **IBM IT Fundamentals for Cybersecurity** badge. This blog is no longer being updated.

### Day 6: Tuesday, 22 December, 2020
**Today's Progress:**  
Today I finished the **Introduction to Databases** and the **Deep Dive. Injection Vulnerability** modules of the **Network Security & Database Vulnerabilities** course, completing all of the material for the **IBM IT Fundamentals for Cybersecurity** specialization certficate.

**Thoughts:**  
6 days ago I signed up for Coursera's 7-day free trial on the  **IBM IT Fundamentals for Cybersecurity** specialization. Today I finished that specialization, earned my certificate, and my free trial was automatically cancelled. A week ago cybersecurity was and always had been a passing interest of mine, but nothing which I had devoted the time and energy into learning like I have in the last few days. These past 6 days have given me a foundation in the basics of cybersecurity from which to grow upon. I still have ***a lot*** to learn, and I'm looking forward to the process of learning it.

Now that I have completed this certificate, I am moving on to work toward the [**IBM Cybersecurity Security Analyst Professional Certificate program**](https://www.ibm.com/training/badge/a471481b-3152-4e09-b43f-ab1d8bf31620). I have created a microblog similar to this on to track my progress [here](cybersecurity-security-analyst-professional-certificate-program.md).

### Day 3: Saturday, 19 December, 2020
**Today's Progress:**  
Today I completed all 4 modules of the **Cybersecurity Roles, Processes & Operating System Security** course (**People Process & Technology**, **Examples & Principles of the CIA Triad; Authentication and Access Control**, **Windows Operating System Security Basics; Linux Operating System Security Basics; macOS Security Basics**, and **Overview of Virtualization**)as well as modules 1 (**Compliance Frameworks and Industry Standards**) and 2 (**Client System Administration, Endpoint Protection and Patching**) of Course 3: **Cybersecurity Compliance Framework & System Administration**.

### Day 2: Friday, 18 December, 2020
**Today's Progress:**  
Today I finished module 2 (****"A brief overview of types of actors and their motives"**), I completed module 3 (**"An overview of key security concepts"**)

---
### Day 1: Thursday, 17 December, 2020
**Today's Progress:**  
Today I completed the materials for module 1 of the **Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools & Cyber Attacks** course. I completed the first module (**"History of Cybersecurity"**) and about 2/3 of the second module (**"A brief overview of types of actors and their motives"**).

**Thoughts:**  
The first module was titled **"History of Cybersecurity"**, but the module covered **much** more than that (in fact history made up a couple of videos and a fraction of the material) and this module could have been more accurately titled **"Introduction to Cybersecurity"**. The material of both modules was full of much less review materials than I experienced with the **Technical Support Fundamentals** course for the [Google IT Support Professional Certificate Program](it-support-pro-certificate-progress.md) and I've found the material both more challenging and much more engaging. I've always had a passing interest in cybersecurity, but actually taking the time to begin learning it and I think I may have accidentally stumbled on a new passion!
