## IBM IT Fundamentals for Cybersecurity Log
This simple microblog was created to track my progress through the [IBM IT Fundamentals for Cybersecurity certificate program](https://www.ibm.com/training/badge/aa8b45a3-df14-4874-87bc-5b8c1276407e).

### Day 5: Wednesday, 16 December, 2020
**Today's Progress:**  
Today I completed weeks 5 and 6 of the *Technical Support Fundamentals* course, which covered software and troubleshooting. As a result, I have now completed the *Technical Support Fundamentals* course in it's entirety with an overall score of 100%. Completing this course felt really good today, and I was looking forward to jumping into next course on networking tomorrow morning. I learned, however, that my financial aid approval was only for the first course and before I can go onto the next course I must apply for another round of financial aid and wait 15 days to find out if I am approved or not. I have completed that application and should have an answer on 31 December, 2020.

**Thoughts:**  
It felt good completing this course, although I felt the material was all a bit too basic for my experience level. My knowledge and skills are certainly not advanced or cutting edge, but they are more intermediate than this course was targeted towards. I still hope that the subsequent courses increase in complexity, and I hope I am approved for the next course *The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking*. I also think I may apply for financial aid for the following courses one day at at time for the next several days.

### Day 4: Tuesday, 15 December, 2020
**Today's Progress:**  
Today I completed week 4 of the *Technical Support Fundamentals* course, which gave a broad overview of networks. 

**Thoughts**  
While I've found the topics of most of the material interesting (if not always new), but networking is just one of those topics that I enjoy a bit more than others. I was part of a network administration program at Heald College circa 2004, so a lot of the really basics of network fundamentals weren't new to me, although IoT wasn't a thing back then and IPv6 was something we talked about being on the horizon, but it was not something that had much use yet. Overall the material for the networking course lacked the depth I would have hoped for, but there are courses on networking and cyber security later in the certificate program, so I'm assuming all of the materials for the first 6 lessons are surface level and that once I get to the second course devoted to networking in a couple of days, things will start going a bit deeper.

### Day 3: Monday, 14 December, 2020
**Today's Progress:**  
Today I completed week 3 of the *Technical Support Fundamentals* course, which covered operating systems. Today's materials, like much of the preceeding material, was mostly review for me. The assessment for the week required me to created a new file in both a Windows 10 and a Linux CLI environment. The task itself was obviously incredibly easy, but I did learn a little in the process because I needed to install and setup Microsoft Remote Desktop for macOS in order to connect to a virtual machine to perform the Windows task, which while not complicated, was a new experience for me. Using Terminal to connect to the Linux machine via SSH was obviously much quicker as I'm fairly experienced with the command line and I didn't need to install any third-party software to complete the task.

**Thoughts:**  
It's obvious that this course material is design to build upon itself, so we need to start with the most basic of basics, and while I'm finding the material just interesting enough to keep me engaged, I'm hoping that the material will become more complicated and present more of a challenge as it progresses. On one hand, completing this material may be useful whether I learn much or not, because it will present me with a certificate at the end to show that I am competant in the skills at hand; on the other hand, if I'm going to devote all this time and energy into learning something, I'm hopeful that there will be some real **learning** that comes into play for me at some point. It's also just possible that, having a background in IT and having worked in various entry-level tech roles over the last couple of decades has given me more knowledge than I realized I had.

### Day 2: Friday, 18 December, 2020
**Today's Progress:**  
Today I finished module 2 (****"A brief overview of types of actors and their motives"**), I completed module 3 (**"An overview of key security concepts"**)

### Day 1: Thursday, 17 December, 2020
**Today's Progress:**  
Today I completed the materials for module 1 of the **Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools & Cyber Attacks** course. I completed the first module (**"History of Cybersecurity"**) and about 2/3 of the second module (**"A brief overview of types of actors and their motives"**).

**Thoughts:**  
The first module was titled **"History of Cybersecurity"**, but the module covered **much** more than that (in fact history made up a couple of videos and a fraction of the material) and this module could have been more accurately titled **"Introduction to Cybersecurity"**. The material of both modules was full of much less review materials than I experienced with the **Technical Support Fundamentals** course for the [Google IT Support Professional Certificate Program](it-support-pro-certificate-progress.md) and I've found the material both more challenging and much more engaging. I've always had a passing interest in cybersecurity, but actually taking the time to begin learning it and I think I may have accidentally stumbled on a new passion!
